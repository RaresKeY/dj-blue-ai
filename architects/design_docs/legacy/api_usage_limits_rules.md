# API Usage Limits Rules (Design Delta)

- **Last Updated: 2026-02-21**
- **Status**: Deduplicated. Config keys, defaults, clamps, and enforcement paths are maintained in specs.

## Canonical Runtime Docs
- `specs/domain_logic.md`
- `specs/data_model.md`

## Non-Normative Design Guidance
- UI warning threshold near 80% monthly budget can improve operator visibility.
- Additional confirmation UX at budget exhaustion can be added later if product wants a soft-stop interaction.

These are product recommendations, not guaranteed runtime behavior.
