- **Status**: Deduplicated. Runtime flow details are maintained in specs.

## Canonical Runtime Docs
- `specs/product_context.md`
- `specs/system_architecture.md`
- `specs/domain_logic.md`

## Historical Note Kept Here
- Earlier design iterations described chat context caching behavior that no longer matches current implementation.
- Treat this file as historical context for evolution discussions, not runtime truth.
